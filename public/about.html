<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Welcome everyone to a page about me. Let me introduce myself. My name is Julie Savino
  and if were to ask me to say a little something about myself I 
  would start off with the fact that I love Jesus. He has saved my life and since living
  for Him I have been set free from drugs, alcohol and a lifestyle in darkness. I now know 
  I am His child and I am free from anxiety, depression, sickness and living in the 
  fullness of God. I just want to shout on the mountain tops how much He loves You!!!
</p>

<p>Second to my love of Jesus Christ, I have a beautiful family. I have two beautiful daughters,
  Savannah and Ashley. I have a gorgeous grandson, Rex and two of the best Son in Laws.</p>

<p>What do I like to do for fun? Glad you asked. I love anything outdoors; from hiking to picnics to kayaking or reading a book on the beach, I love the fresh air. 
  I love trying new food and going on trip advisor to see what my state has to offer. I love road trips.
  I like to hang out with family and friends and I love talking about Jesus.
